#' Calculate the Dice distance between all pairs of columns in a matrix.
#' The Dice distance is defined as the number of positions in two vectors
#' at which the corresponding symbols or different. Here, the Dice distance
#' is applied to the presence/absence of each gene, whereby
#' measurements that are missing or equal to zero are considered as zeroes and
#' all other measurements are considered as ones. This is a wrapper for the
#' philentropy distance function, that converts a numeric matrix to a 
#' presence/absence matrix.

#' @param mat a matrix of data, with samples in rows and features in columns
#' @return the Dice coefficient between non-zero/missing values in each pair of 
#'   columns
