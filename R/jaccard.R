#' Calculate the Jaccard index between all pairs of columns in a matrix.
#' The Jaccard index (also known as the Tanimoto coefficient) is defined as the 
#' size of the intersection of two bitsets divided by the size of the union. 
#' Here, to convert a list of continuous expression values into a set of bits,
#' measurements that are missing or equal to zero are considered as zeroes and
#' all other measurements are considered as ones. 
#' 
#' @param mat a matrix of data, with samples in rows and features in columns
#' @return the Jaccard index between non-zero/missing values in each pair of 
#'   columns
