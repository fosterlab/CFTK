#' Calculate the Hamming distance between all pairs of columns in a matrix.
#' The Hamming distance is defined as the number of positions in two vectors
#' at which the corresponding symbols or different. Here, the Hamming distance
#' is applied to the presence/absence of each gene, whereby
#' measurements that are missing or equal to zero are considered as zeroes and
#' all other measurements are considered as ones.
