\title{Calculate the Jaccard index between all columns in a matrix}
\usage{
jaccard(mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{a matrix of data, with samples in rows and features in columns}
}
\value{
the Jaccard index between non-zero/missing values in each pair of 
  columns
}
\description{
Calculate the Jaccard index between all pairs of columns in a matrix.
The Jaccard index (also known as the Tanimoto coefficient) is defined as the 
size of the intersection of two bitsets divided by the size of the union. 
Here, to convert a list of continuous expression values into a set of bits,
measurements that are missing or equal to zero are considered as zeroes and
all other measurements are considered as ones.

\examples{
mat = matrix(c(1, rep(0, 9), rep(1, 4), rep(0, 6)), ncol = 2)
jaccard(mat)
mat = cbind(mat, c(0, rep(1, 5), rep(0, 4)))
